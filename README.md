# forest-analysis-utilities-R
R codes that are general purpose such as segmentation, pixel value extraction, structural-spectral analysis.

Lab is new to github. We will be storing customized R utilities here that relate to forest canopy and individual tree analysis. Codes are differentiated based on task. For instance, watershed segmentation code should be separate from pixel extraction using shapefile code.
